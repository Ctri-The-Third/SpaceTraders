Executive Summary

An API wrapper for the [SpaceTraders API](https://spacetraders.io/) written in Python.
Implemented as an object-oriented wrapper around the [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library.

Reinventing the wheel for fun, and to express recent learnings.

Eventually will be used to build an interactive gameplay UI built on top of the API.
