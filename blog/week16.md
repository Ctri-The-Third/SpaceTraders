# week 16

version 2.1 was delayed so I'm shoring up the codebase and continuing work on the visualiser.
I want to achieve the following:

* Render a given system
* show ship locations / counts of ships at a given location

Then I want a mechanism by which I can orchestrate new tasks for ships via a UI.
