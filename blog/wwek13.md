# week 13

week 12 was also a minor week. Our focus during that week was instrumenting dedicated surveyors, but we never got around to that, sadly.
That said the week 12 performance was extremely high in terms of CPR after we knocked out all the API calls from the conductor. 

This week I'd like to continue working on the dedicated surveyor behaviour. 
Our questions for study were:
* Next week (12) - Does switching to dedicated surveying hounds / frigates make sense? (repurposing the starting frigate absolutely does)
 * ANSWER: Yes
* The current production chain of haulers and refiners definitely adds money into the system. Is it breaking even? Is the opportunity cost worth it? (perform queries and chart this)
 * ANSWER: unknown
* Week 13 - does having ore hounds that can't transfer cargo leave the asteroid to sell make sense? (Determine CPR and CPH estimations)
* the recon dispatcher is not behaving correctly and is trying to use the wrong token for some ships.
