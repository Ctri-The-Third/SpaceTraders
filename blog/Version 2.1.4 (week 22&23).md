goals for the week - 
* Complete as many missions as possible
* evolve markets

# Week 22 - Version 2.1.4
After last week I have a solid understanding that gameplay needs to focus on keeping markets un restricted.
I also recognised that transport shuttles were woefully inadequite at handling trades, and that we'll swap to a more expensive hauler based model for this week.

I intend to have node U as my experimental node, node V as my control node running last reset's code. Half way through the reset I'll deploy my experimental code so far to node C.
