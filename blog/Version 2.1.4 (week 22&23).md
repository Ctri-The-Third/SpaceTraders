goals for the week - 
* Complete as many missions as possible
* evolve markets

# Week 22 - Version 2.1.4
After last week I have a solid understanding that gameplay needs to focus on keeping markets un restricted.
I also recognised that transport shuttles were woefully inadequite at handling trades, and that we'll swap to a more expensive hauler based model for this week.

I intend to have node U as my experimental node, node V as my control node running last reset's code. Half way through the reset I'll deploy my experimental code so far to node C.


## Rocky start 

The working capital safety didn't get respected by the minutely update, unfortunately. This means that we're currently trading below capacity.

I made the decision to focus ship_parts and ship_plating, as the exports outweigh the import trade_volumes, so we should be able to ramp that up fairly early on without needing to evolve the supplying imports.

Ships are scaling up though. We have enough probes, and are slowly building our siphoners.  I realised with tha co-located exchange for the siphoners, there's no reason to use "siphon_and_chill" when I could use "extract_and_go_sell". This is ensuring that despite operating below the safe limits, we'll be able to afford fuel for timely trading. We'll need to alter our mining packaging behaviour and maybe look at ships who have been immobile for a little while or something.

We'll need to remember to have ships that can sit on that exchange and sell the stored goods when the reach suitable prices. The exchange will take some margin, but the uncoupling this allows is definitely going to be worth it.

When we get mining drones, will need to factor in proximity to a market as well, if we can find one that is <40 units we'll be in a good place. If we do <80 units we might need to be clever with fuel.

* Currently we're setting the commander to manage an export immediately, instead of fuel. The commander is running out of things to do when the market is not valid for managing that export. Currently this is because the behaviour does not factor getting imports into the market unless the market is restricted.
* The conductor needs to track permanent assignments and assign priority based tasks until they're complete. 
* single trading tasks should have a FUEL_ requirement that is the largest single hop in the pathfinder. 
* QUESTION - should we just switch to a task based system, and fall back to behaviours?
  * much harder to troubleshoot.


## node V 

We missed some early behaviours with node V, and unfortuantely it's not generating any credits. I'll need to look into why the contract tasks aren't being picked up by the dispatcher and maybe fix that one thing tomorrow.


## tracking progress on market growth and changes.

I want a system-wide view of tradegoods and their market states. 
Clicking into them should show an interweaved set of transactions, and activity /supply changes on a minute to minute basis, as well as any ships responsible for making those transactions.

I want to be able to see which markets are restricted.

âœ… A per-listing graph showing the export market(s) and the import market(s) with their prices over time, supply state, and activity stat should be provided.
now a mechanism that, for each of these exports, shows the dependancy chain and their states. 
State health calculated by 
* Activity (if not restricted)
* No items sold (if > 0 )
* Supply
