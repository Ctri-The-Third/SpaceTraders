# Week 20 - Version 2.1.2

This week they added balance changes for market evolution. 
I observe a 3:1 ratio between imports and exports, instead of 10:1 as before.
They also added a "RESTRICTED" activity - an indicator that lack of imports are throttling the export.

at 1am we went from LIMITED to MODERATE and by 01:34 we had reached ABUNDANT, and continued to overfill that market overnight.

at 7am we intervened and began exporting the FUEL produced. 
note - the overabundance of HYDROCARBONS did not impact the export price / supply at all. 
at 07:22, the export trade evolume of FUEL evolved from 10 to 20, but the supply of HYDROCARBONS remains oversaturated.


Successful evolution of export starts by pushing the IMPORT supply beyond ABUNDANT, and if not crashing that market then certainly denting it past profitability.

The second step is to drop the EXPORT market down to SCARCE. If the two conditions are sufficiently met, then the EXPORT market will evolve.
the IMPORT market has not yet evolved.

We will continue exporting fuel (all the import markets are trade_volume 100 so there's no risk of crashing them), and see if either market evolves.
